# Cockpit CMS Documentation

This is the unofficial documentation and code reference for [the Cockpit CMS](https://getcockpit.com) created by awesome cosmonauts from [Zeraton](https://zeraton.de), a software and web development company from Munich.

Cockpit CMS is a versatile API-based content management system based on PHP and SQLite or MongoDB and Redis. It can be hosted on almost any kind of webspace supporting PHP with the SQLite extension.

For installation infos refer to [Getting Started](/guide/basics/) and [Docker Usage](/guide/basics/docker.md).

Technical in-depth documentation is available [here](/documentation/) and there also is a [Basic Code Documentation](https://codedocs.webdevz.io).
