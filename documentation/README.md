# Developers Documentation

This portion of docs is meant for developers creating own
[Add-Ons](/guide/addons/) or contributing to the core project. Most concepts and
information outlined here goes more into the depths of Cockpits codebase
initially mostly developed by [Artur Heinze](https://agentejo.com/) ([@aheinze](https://github.com/aheinze)).
